            <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Qiang (Steven) Wu, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the Bush School of Government & Public Service, Texas A&M University. My academic journey delves into the relationship between international political economy and international security, particularly highlighting U.S.-China Relations within the context of the Indo-Pacific region. Additionally, I investigate the nexus between democratization and trade liberalization, as well as public opinion concerning trade policy and globalization.<br><br>
                
Reflecting on my academic and personal experiences, I believe I've uniquely positioned myself to undertake this research. My foundational understanding of political science stems from my M.A. in International Relations and a B.A. in Political Science, both from Peking University. To complement this, I obtained an M.A. in Economics from Kyoto University, broadening my grasp of the economic landscape. I then melded these disciplines by securing an M.A. in International Economics and China Studies from Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), specializing in Economic Policy.<br><br>

My real-world expertise in East Asia is vast. I gained firsthand insights into politics and foreign policy during my tenure at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress in China. Two immersive years in Japan enhanced my understanding of its academic landscape and societal nuances. Moreover, my experience working for a Korean multinational corporation for two years enriched my knowledge of Korean business practices and cultural intricacies.<br><br>
