            <p>Hello, and welcome to my website! I'm Qiang (Steven) Wu, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the Bush School of Government & Public Service, Texas A&M University. My academic journey delves deep into the intricate relationship between international political economy and international security, with a particular emphasis on U.S.-China Relations.<br><br> <!-- Use <br> to introduce space between paragraphs -->
I've had the privilege of gaining professional experience in China, including roles at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress and at Peking University. Prior to joining Texas A&M, I earned an M.A. in International Economics and China Studies from Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies, with a specialization on Economic Policy. My educational background also includes an M.A. in Economics from Kyoto University, as well as an M.A. in International Relations and a B.A. in Political Science from Peking University.<br><br>
