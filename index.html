            <p>Welcome! I'm Qiang (Steven) Wu, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the Bush School of Government & Public Service, Texas A&M University. My academic journey delves into the intricate dynamics of international political economy and international security, with a focus on U.S.-China Relations. I also explore the interplay between democratization and trade liberalization, and investigate public opinions around globalization, particularly regarding trade policies.<br><br>
                
My multifaceted academic background have positioned me to navigate this research trajectory. I grounded myself in political science with a B.A. in Political Science and an M.A. in International Relations from Peking University. Further expanding my academic spectrum, I acquired an M.A. in Economics from Kyoto University. I later integrated these disciplines by securing an M.A. in International Economics and China Studies from Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), where I refined my research interests as I transitioned to the doctoral stage.<br><br>

Beyond academia, my diverse field experiences across the Indo-Pacific and beyond have deepened my understanding of societal dynamics and inspired substantive research questions. I gained firsthand insights into politics and foreign policy during my tenure at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress in China. Two immersive years in Japan enhanced my understanding of its academic and societal contexts. Moreover, my experience working for a South Korean multinational corporation for two years gave me invaluable knowledge of Korean corporate governance and culture. My travels as part of official and academic delegations to countries like Thailand, Germany, Italy, and Russia further broadened my global outlook.<br><br>
