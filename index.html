            <p>Welcome! I'm Qiang (Steven) Wu, currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Political Science at the Bush School of Government & Public Service, Texas A&M University. My academic journey delves into the dynamics of international political economy and international security, with a focus on China and the U.S.-led liberal international order. Another strand of my research examines globalization—specifically trade policy—and its interplay with domestic political institutions and public opinions.<br><br>
                
My multifaceted academic background has equipped me to pursue this research trajectory. I grounded myself in political science with a B.A. in Political Science and an M.A. in International Relations from Peking University. Further expanding my academic spectrum, I acquired an M.A. in Economics from Kyoto University. I later integrated these disciplines by obtaining an M.A. in International Economics and China Studies from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (Johns Hopkins SAIS), where I refined my research interests as I transitioned to the doctoral stage.<br><br>

In addition to academic training, my diverse field experiences across the Indo-Pacific and beyond have deepened my understanding of real-world politics and inspired substantive research questions. I made firsthand observations of politics and foreign policy during my eight-year tenure at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People’s Congress in China. Two immersive years in Japan enhanced my understanding of its academic and social contexts. Moreover, my experience working for a South Korean multinational corporation for two years gave me knowledge of Korean economy and culture. My travels as part of official and academic delegations to countries like Thailand, Russia, Germany, and Italy further broadened my global outlook.<br><br>

I secured first place in the Business and Political Science Section during the 2023 Student Research Week Competition at Texas A&M University. In 2020, I earned second place for the Henry Owen Memorial Award granted by the Bretton Woods Committee. Additionally, I have received fellowships from institutions like the Cato Institute, Institute for Humane Studies, National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, Northeast Asia Economic Forum, and Japan International Cooperation Agency.
