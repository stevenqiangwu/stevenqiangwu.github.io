    <h1>Forum on the United States, China, and the World Order</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <p>The Forum on the United States, China, and the World Order was established by Qiang (Steven) Wu in September 2024. The forum aims to foster academic communication between students and scholars.
Through this platform, scholars present their latest research to university students, who actively participate by asking questions and debating issues related to the United States, China, and the world order. By engaging directly with these scholars, students gain valuable insights into cutting-edge research and have the opportunity to explore both the scholars' work and broader topics within the field. For scholars, the forum provides a unique opportunity to understand how their research is perceived and interpreted by university-level readers, fostering a meaningful exchange of ideas. 
Details of the first five lectures hosted by the forum during Fall 2024 are outlined below:</p>
